(1) Cloud-Based Scheduling for API Calls

Instead of relying on the mobile device to check the date and time and trigger actions—which can be unreliable, especially on iOS—we offload this scheduling to the cloud. When a user sets a scheduled event (like sending an SMS via Twilio), the app saves the event details (including the trigger time) in a cloud database (such as Firestore). A cloud function (for example, a Firebase Cloud Function) then periodically checks the database for any events that are due. When it finds one, the cloud function automatically calls the relevant API (e.g., Twilio) to perform the action. This approach ensures that scheduled events are executed reliably, regardless of whether the mobile app is running or if the device is connected at that moment.
